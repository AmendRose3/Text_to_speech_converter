This HTML and JavaScript project converts text input into speech. It allows users to enter text in a textarea and choose from available voices through a dropdown menu. When the "Listen!" button is clicked, the text is read aloud using the Web Speech APIâ€™s SpeechSynthesis feature. The user can select a voice from the browser's available voices, and the selected voice will be used to speak the entered text. The interface is simple and clean, with a button to initiate the speech synthesis.
